Capris is a MIT-licensed Python library built for writing
composable apps that leverage the command line.

A simple example of writing your own git wrapper, complete
with other command-line utilities that you love and use on
a daily basis:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from capris import Command
    >>> git, grep = Command('git'), Command('grep')

    >>> pipe = git.log(n=10, pretty="oneline") | grep(r'[a-f0-9]\{40\}', o=None)
    >>> str(pipe)
    "git log -n 10 --pretty=oneline | grep -o [a-f0-9]\{40\}"

    >>> response = pipe.run()
    >>> response.status_code
    0
    >>> print response.std_out
    ...

``capris`` allows you to write code or tests that just calls
commands and helps you focus on writing the `commands that you
need`, not the code required to handle calling and getting
responses from the commands. ``capris`` does all of the mucking
around with strings and escaping for you.
