Capris
======

Capris is a semantically versioned, MIT-licensed Python library
built for writing composable apps that leverage external
programs. A simple example of writing your own git wrapper,
complete with other command-line utilities that you love and use
on a daily basis:

.. code-block:: python

    from capris import Command
    git, grep = Command('git'), Command('grep')

    pipe = git.log(n=10, pretty="oneline") | grep(r'[a-f0-9]\{40\}', o=None)
    response = pipe.run()
    print response.std_out

``capris`` allows you to write code or tests that just calls
commands and helps you focus on writing the `commands that you
need`, not the code required to handle calling and getting
responses from the commands. ``capris`` does all of the mucking
around with strings and escaping for you.

Contributing
------------

If you want to contribute, we follow the Github workflow, so fork
the repo, work on the code and just make a pull request (make sure
all tests pass beforehand, at least in the last commit of your pull
request). In short:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ git clone ssh://git@github.com/$USERNAME/graphlite.git
    $ cd graphlite
    $ git checkout -b $FEATURE
    $ # hackedy hack hack
    $ py.test tests
    $ git commit -a
    $ git push

Note that we use py.test for testing so if you haven't, make sure
you pip install pytest. But you should.
